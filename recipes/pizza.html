<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This is one of my favorite pizza recipes. It all started when I was a young boy consuming pizza at the local pizza restaurant. I thought I wanted a way to make pizza like this at home.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy the pizza as much as I enjoyed making it! It is an Neapolitan style Margherita pizza.</p>
